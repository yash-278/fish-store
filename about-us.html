            <p>
              Monitoring of soil and water quality conditions can be valuable in aquaculture pond
              management, so some selected procedures will be provided. Most small-scale farmers
              will not be able to conduct these simple analyses, so comments about visual evaluation
              of soil also are provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comprehensive soil horizon analysis at multiple sampling locations within each
              potential site are performed as part of our overall aquaculture feasibility studies
              whenever soils may be suitable for earthen pond construction. Soil pH testing is done
              on-site for all boreholes and at multiple soil sampling horizons. General on-site
              observations on soil type are also be made. A certified United States lab will perform
              a comprehensive soil texture analysis and soil chemical analysis of all major and
              minor soil nutrients for multiple samples taken from the most suitable sites. We will
              then review soil quality test results against optimum criteria for aquaculture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soil texture classification is determined by the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in
              a given sample. From these percentages, soils are then classified by type according to
              the soil triangle. Soils suitable for earthen pond construction must contain a minimum
              of 20-30% clay and preferably no more than 30% sand. The best types of soil for
              aquaculture are classified as clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Water</h3>
            <p>
              Maintenance of water quality parameters in optimal level is critical for successful
              aquaculture operations.It is essential to monitor pH, dissolved oxygen( DO) and the
              toxic metabolites like ammonia and nitrite which are critical for survival of aquatic
              animals. During the culture knowing the concentration of essential minerals like
              calcium and magnesium in pond waters help in avoiding unnecessary application of
              minerals and reducing the cost of production. Different kits have been developed for
              detection of these parameters in aquaculture ponds and related aquatic environment.
              Regular monitoring of this parameter in hatcheries and grow-out farms will help in
              taking up immediate measures of preventing the economic loss.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Aeration</h3>
            <p>
              Aeration brings water and air in close contact in order to remove dissolved gases
              (such as carbon dioxide) and oxidizes dissolved metals such as iron, hydrogen sulfide,
              and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Aquaculture pond aeration is vital to the vigorous health and vitality of fish.
              Without enough oxygen, fish become stressed and their growth rate slows. Additionally,
              the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the pond will allow the build-up of fish waste and
              other organic nutrients.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Future Scope</h3>
            <p>
              Now a days aquaculture, or the science of breeding fishes in ‘fish farms’ is becoming
              quite popular and making a substantial contribution to the supermarket freezers for
              both fresh and saltwater fishes. In 2010, the annual capture of fish, both wild as
              well as farmed, accounted for up to a whopping 149 million tonnes. Over 90% of the
              world’s freshwater fish are caught in the Developing Countries and provide a major
              protein source as well as a form of livelihood to millions of poor people. Freshwater
              fishes and their habitats contribute to the economy through export commodity trade,
              tourism and recreational activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The freshwater fish is generally being cultured in earthen ponds under the provision
              of fertilization and supplementary feeding. At present, the average freshwater fish
              production is 2.9 t/ha and to achieve the fish production of 8.0 MMT in next five
              years, the present fish production level is to be enhanced to 4-5 t/ha. This increase
              in fish production from the existing level of 2.9 t/ha to 4-5 t/ha is possible only
              through the provision of supplementary feeding. Feed is the highest recurring cost in
              modern day aquaculture constituting about 50-60% of the total production cost. By
              2050, the targeted freshwater fish production is 17.0 MMT and to achieve this target,
              about 23 MMT of feed is required. The availability of fish feed ingredients would be
              the major challenge for the aqua culturists in the coming years. Therefore, the much
              valued available feed resources must be used judiciously through proper feed and
              feeding management practices.
            </p>

              Fish has long been known as a great source of protein and low in fat. It is reality
              that most people probably don’t get enough fish in their diet, and thus don’t reap the
              benefits of fish. We know that adding fish to your diet is beneficial to your health,
              but do you realize all the health benefits of fish? The list really goes on as far as
              benefits are concerned, so we decided round up a few of the most important to
              eliminate you having to do any research.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Healthy Diet Benefits</h3>
            <p>
              Fish tends to be a really great source of lean protein and it’s typically really low
              in fat. High protein + low fat, it is very good in health point of view. Additionally,
              fish is filled with omega 3 fatty acids and other vitamins that our bodies flourish
              when given. In fact, the American Heart Association even advises that people eat fish
              at least a couple times a week because of the incredible benefits found in this food
              source. The American Heart Association also advocates eating fish regularly because
              studies have found that eating it on a regular basis can lower your risk of heart
              attack, stroke and blood pressure.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Heart + Brain Health</h3>
            <p>
              So aside from a great food to add to your diet for well, diet and other health
              reasons, fish has also been found to help increase your heart and brain health. It’s
              all thanks to those omega 3 fatty acids. You’ve probably heard about people take fish
              oil pills because of the benefits – eating them is even better!.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">
              Some of the major benefits of these omega 3 fatty acids:
            </h3>
            <p>
              Can help reduce inflammation. <br />
              May reduce the risk of depression.<br />
              Help with lowering blood pressure.<br />
              May reduce symptoms and risk of arthritis.<br />
              Important to development of child while pregnant.<br />
              Can help with brain/mental health troubles in elderly.<br />

            <p>
              Freshwater fish are those that spend some or all of their lives in fresh water, such
              as rivers and lakes, with a salinity of less than 0.05%. These environments differ
              from marine conditions in many ways, the most obvious being the difference in levels
              of salinity. To survive fresh water, the fish need a range of physiological
              adaptations. 41.24% of all known species of fish are found in fresh water. This is
              primarily due to the rapid speciation that the scattered habitats make possible. When
              dealing with ponds and lakes, one might use the same basic models of speciation as
              when studying island biogeography.
