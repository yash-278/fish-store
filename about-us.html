              <p>
                With almost seven billion people on earth, the demand for aquatic food carries on to
                increase and hence, expansion and inten-siﬁcation of aquaculture production are
                highly required. The prime goal of aquaculture expansion must be to produce more
                aquaculture products without signiﬁcantly increasing the usage of the basic nat-
                ural resources of water and land (Avnimelech, 2009). The second goal is to develop
                sustainable aquaculture systems that will not damage the environment (Naylor et al.,
                2000). The third goal is to build up systems providing an equitable cost/beneﬁt
                ratio to support economic and social sustainability (Avnimelech, 2009). All these
                three prerequisites for sustainable aquaculture development can be met by bioﬂoc
                technology.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">The strengths of bioﬂoc technology</h3>
            <p>
              Bioﬂoc technology makes it possible to minimize water exchange and water usage in
              aquaculture systems through maintaining ade- quate water quality within the culture
              unit, while producing low cost bioﬂocs rich in protein, which in turn can serve as a
              feed for aquatic organisms (Crab, 2010; Crab et al., 2007, 2009, 2010a). Com- pared to
              conventional water treatment technologies used in aquacul- ture, bioﬂoc technology
              provides a more economical alternative (decrease of water treatment expenses in the
              order of 30%), and addi- tionally, a potential gain on feed expenses (the efﬁciency of
              protein utilization is twice as high in bioﬂoc technology systems when Inorganic N

            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">The use of bioﬂocs as a feed for aquaculture species</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to the growing demand for seafood for human con- sumption, the demand for
              aquatic products used by the industrial sector for conversion into ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil
              products also increases (Péron et al., 2010). <br />
              Fishmeal and ﬁsh oil are used as feed for other human food supply systems, such as
              poultry, pigs and aquaculture. Hitherto, part of the aquaculture production relies on
              wild ﬁsh har- vests, as ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil are essential elements of the diet of many
              aquaculture species, both carnivorous and herbivorous ﬁsh and shrimp. <br />About 5–6
              million tonnes of low-value/trash ﬁsh are used as direct feed in aquaculture worldwide
              either provided without processing or as part of farm-made feeds (FAO, 2009). FAO
              (2009) reported that the total amount of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil used in aquafeeds is
              estimated to have grown more than threefold between 1992 and 2006, from 0.96 million
              tonnes to 3.06 million tonnes and from 0.23 million tonnes to 0.78 million tonnes,
              respectively. For the 10 types of ﬁsh most regularly farmed, a mean of 1.9 kg of wild
              ﬁsh is required for every kilogram of ﬁsh produced (Naylor et al., 2000).<br />
              In terms of ﬁshmeal, many intensive and semi-intensive aquaculture systems use 2 to 5
              times more ﬁsh protein to feed the farmed species than is supplied by the farmed
              product (Naylor et al., 2000). There- fore, research in recent times has focused on
              the development of feed substitution strategies with a minimal supply of ﬁshmeal and
              ﬁsh oil, which are then replaced by alternative and cheaper sources of protein such as
              plant proteins.<br />
              In contrast to intensive and semi- intensive systems, extensive and traditional
              systems already use little or no ﬁshmeal, and farmers often supply nutrient-rich
              materials to the water to enhance growth of algae and other indigenous organ- isms on
              which the ﬁsh can feed (Naylor et al., 2000). This inspired re- searchers to develop
              the bioﬂoc technology, which is also applicable to intensive and semi-intensive
              systems. <br />With bioﬂoc technology, where nitrogenous waste generated by the
              cultivated organisms is converted into bacterial biomass (containing protein), in situ
              feed production is stimulated through the addition of an external carbon source
              (Schneider et al., 2005). Although bioﬂocs show an adequate protein, lipid,
              carbohydrate and ash content for use as an aquaculture feed (Crab et al., 2010a), more
              research is needed on their amino acid and fatty acid composi- tion. Now, ﬁshmeal and
              ﬁsh oil supply essential amino acids (such as lysine and methionine) that are deﬁcient
              in plant proteins and fatty acids (eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid) not
              found in vegetable oils (Naylor et al., 2000). Herbivorous, omnivorous and car-
              nivorous ﬁnﬁsh all necessitate about the same amount of dietary protein per unit
              weight, but herbivorous and omnivorous species uti- lize plant-based proteins and oils
              better and they require minimal quantities of ﬁshmeal to supply essential amino acids
              (Naylor et al., 2000).<br />
              However, compound feeds for omnivorous ﬁsh often exceed required levels (Naylor et
              al., 2000). On the other hand, lowering the input of wild ﬁsh required for production
              of farmed carnivorous ﬁsh seems not feasible at this time. As already discussed above,
              it is very important to inform the farmers clearly and thoroughly, at this juncture
              about feeding strategies and management. New initiatives by governments and funding
              organizations are needed that can act as incentives for aquaculture to augment farming
              of low trophic level with herbivorous diets in stead of high-value, carnivorous ﬁsh
              that increases the need for ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil, which in turn could place even more
              stress on pelagic ﬁsheries, resulting in high feed prices and damage to marine
              ecosystems (Naylor et al., 2000). Con- comitantly, more research is needed regarding
              feed replacement strategies such as using vegetable oils, meat byproducts and also
              bio- ﬂoc technology. With bioﬂoc technology, one also needs to consider that the
              choice of cultivated species should take into account their ca- pability of dealing
              with high suspended solid concentrations, since this negatively affects certain ﬁsh
              species. Another important factor that is essential for the growth and sur- vival of
              aquaculture species are vitamins. We measured before vita- min C concentrations in
              bioﬂocs ranging from 0 to 54 μg/g dry matter (Crab, 2010).<br />
              These values are below the required concentra- tion for ﬁsh and shrimp. Besides
              vitamin C, other vitamins such as thi- amine, riboﬂavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid,
              nicotinic acid, biotin, folic acid, vitamin B12, inositol, choline, vitamin A, vitamin
              D3, vita- min E and vitamin K, are usually not sufﬁciently synthesized by the cultured
              organism either and need to be supplied through the feed.<br />
              Hence, it needs to be established to what extent bioﬂocs can contrib- ute to the
              supply of these essential nutrients. Several studies were performed on the use of
              bioﬂocs as an in situ produced feed and they indicate that bioﬂocs can be taken up by
              aquaculture species and uptake depends on the species and feeding traits, animal size,
              ﬂoc size and ﬂoc density (Avnimelech, 2009; Crab, 2010; Crab et al., 2009, 2010a).
              <br />Our previous work revealed that giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium
              rosenbergii), whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and tilapia (Oreochromis
              niloticus× Oreochromis aureus) were all able to take up bioﬂocs and proﬁt from this
              additional protein source. This indicates that bioﬂoc tech- nology is applicable to
              both freshwater and seawater systems, both to control water quality and to produce as
              an additional feed source in situ. <br />The potential feed gain of the application of
              bioﬂoc technology is estimated to be in the order of 10–20% (De Schryver et al.,
              2008). With this, production costs will decline considerably since food represents
              40–50% of the total production costs (Craig and Helfrich, 2002). A variety of
              beneﬁcial features can be ascribed to bioﬂoc technol- ogy, from water quality control
              to in situ feed production and some possible extra features.<br />
              Bioﬂoc technology offers aquaculture a sus- tainable tool to simultaneously address
              its environmental, social and economical issues concurrent with its growth.
              Researchers are chal- lenged to further develop this technique and farmers to
              implement it in their future aquaculture systems.<br />
              The basics of the technology is there, but its further development, ﬁne-tuning and
              implementation will need further research and development from the present and fu-
              ture generation of researchers, farmers and consumers to make this technique a
              keystone of future sustainable aquaculture.

              potential site are performed as part of our overall aquaculture feasibility studies
              whenever soils may be suitable for earthen pond construction. Soil pH testing is done
              on-site for all boreholes and at multiple soil sampling horizons. General on-site
              observations on soil type are also be made. A certified United States lab will perform
              a comprehensive soil texture analysis and soil chemical analysis of all major and
              minor soil nutrients for multiple samples taken from the most suitable sites. We will
              then review soil quality test results against optimum criteria for aquaculture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soil texture classification is determined by the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in
              a given sample. From these percentages, soils are then classified by type according to
              the soil triangle. Soils suitable for earthen pond construction must contain a minimum
              of 20-30% clay and preferably no more than 30% sand. The best types of soil for
              aquaculture are classified as clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">WATER</h3>
            <p>
              Maintenance of water quality parameters in optimal level is critical for successful
              aquaculture operations.It is essential to monitor pH, dissolved oxygen( DO) and the
              toxic metabolites like ammonia and nitrite which are critical for survival of aquatic
              animals. During the culture knowing the concentration of essential minerals like
              calcium and magnesium in pond waters help in avoiding unnecessary application of
              minerals and reducing the cost of production. Different kits have been developed for
              detection of these parameters in aquaculture ponds and related aquatic environment.
              Regular monitoring of this parameter in hatcheries and grow-out farms will help in
              taking up immediate measures of preventing the economic loss.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">AERATION</h3>
            <p>
              Aeration brings water and air in close contact in order to remove dissolved gases
              (such as carbon dioxide) and oxidizes dissolved metals such as iron, hydrogen sulfide,
              and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Aquaculture pond aeration is vital to the vigorous health and vitality of fish.
              Without enough oxygen, fish become stressed and their growth rate slows. Additionally,
              the lack of oxygen at the bottom of the pond will allow the build-up of fish waste and
              other organic nutrients.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">WHY AEROLAKE?</h3>

            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">FUTURE SCOPE</h3>
            <p>
              Now a days aquaculture, or the science of breeding fishes in ‘fish farms’ is becoming
              quite popular and making a substantial contribution to the supermarket freezers for
              both fresh and saltwater fishes. In 2010, the annual capture of fish, both wild as
              well as farmed, accounted for up to a whopping 149 million tonnes. Over 90% of the
              world’s freshwater fish are caught in the Developing Countries and provide a major
              protein source as well as a form of livelihood to millions of poor people. Freshwater
              fishes and their habitats contribute to the economy through export commodity trade,
              tourism and recreational activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The freshwater fish is generally being cultured in earthen ponds under the provision
              of fertilization and supplementary feeding. At present, the average freshwater fish
              production is 2.9 t/ha and to achieve the fish production of 8.0 MMT in next five
              years, the present fish production level is to be enhanced to 4-5 t/ha. This increase
              in fish production from the existing level of 2.9 t/ha to 4-5 t/ha is possible only
              through the provision of supplementary feeding. Feed is the highest recurring cost in
              modern day aquaculture constituting about 50-60% of the total production cost. By
              2050, the targeted freshwater fish production is 17.0 MMT and to achieve this target,
              about 23 MMT of feed is required. The availability of fish feed ingredients would be
              the major challenge for the aqua culturists in the coming years. Therefore, the much
              valued available feed resources must be used judiciously through proper feed and
              feeding management practices. Fish has long been known as a great source of protein
              and low in fat. It is reality that most people probably don’t get enough fish in their
              diet, and thus don’t reap the benefits of fish. We know that adding fish to your diet
              is beneficial to your health, but do you realize all the health benefits of fish? The
              list really goes on as far as benefits are concerned, so we decided round up a few of
              the most important to eliminate you having to do any research.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">HEALTHY DIET BENEFITS</h3>
            <p>
              Fish tends to be a really great source of lean protein and it’s typically really low
              in fat. High protein + low fat, it is very good in health point of view. Additionally,
              fish is filled with omega 3 fatty acids and other vitamins that our bodies flourish
              when given. In fact, the American Heart Association even advises that people eat fish
              at least a couple times a week because of the incredible benefits found in this food
              source. The American Heart Association also advocates eating fish regularly because
              studies have found that eating it on a regular basis can lower your risk of heart
              attack, stroke and blood pressure.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">HEART + BRAIN HEALTH</h3>
            <p>
              So aside from a great food to add to your diet for well, diet and other health
              reasons, fish has also been found to help increase your heart and brain health. It’s
              all thanks to those omega 3 fatty acids. You’ve probably heard about people take fish
              oil pills because of the benefits – eating them is even better!.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">
              SOME OF THE MAJOR BENEFITS OF THESE OMEGA 3 FATTY ACIDS:
            </h3>
            <p>
              • Can help reduce inflammation.<br />
              • May reduce the risk of depression.<br />
              • Help with lowering blood pressure.<br />
              • May reduce symptoms and risk of arthritis.<br />
              • Important to development of child while pregnant.<br />
              • Can help with brain/mental health troubles in elderly.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Those are just a few of the most commonly known benefits to adding these essential
              omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. It’s safe to say the benefits are HUGE. While
              there are other foods that have omega-3 fatty acid sources in them, they have found
              that fish has the highest amount and most beneficial amount of these acids.<br />
              Freshwater fish are those that spend some or all of their lives in fresh water, such
              as rivers and lakes, with a salinity of less than 0.05%. These environments differ
              from marine conditions in many ways, the most obvious being the difference in levels
              of salinity. To survive fresh water, the fish need a range of physiological
              adaptations.<br />
              41.24% of all known species of fish are found in fresh water. This is primarily due to
              the rapid speciation that the scattered habitats make possible. When dealing with
              ponds and lakes, one might use the same basic models of speciation as when studying
              island biogeography.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Do fish farms make money ?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, aquaculture can be profitable IF the fish farmer has the right natural resources,
              good management abilities and sufficient capital available for investment in the
              enterprise. ... Fish farming and associated industries have expanded through the
              1980's and 90's. Expansion has slowed somewhat, however, growth continues.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">What is the Biofloc fish farming ?</h3>
            <p>
              Biofloc technology is a technique of enhancing water quality in aquaculture through
              balancing carbon and nitrogen in the system. The technology has recently gained
              attention as a sustainable method to control water quality, with the added value of
              producing proteinaceous feed in situ.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">What is Biofloc fish farming in India ?</h3>
            <p>
              Applying the biofloc technology, farmers can raise fish in artificial tanks with high
              densities in an area of between 150 to 200 square meters connected with piped water
              supply. The system can be used to produce freshwater fish species such as tilapia,
              pangasius, common carp, and others.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Is Biofloc fish healthy ?</h3>
            <p>
              A good nutritional value is found in biofloc. The dry weight protein ranges from 25 –
              50 percent, fat ranges 0.5 – 15 percent. It is a good source of vitamins and minerals,
              particularly phosphorous. It also has an effect similar to probiotics.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Which is better RAS or Biofloc ?</h3>
            <p>
              Individual shrimp weights, total biomass, and FCR were all significantly better in the
              CW treatment compared to the BF treatment. ... The results of this study indicate that
              clear-water RAS may be a more productive option than biofloc systems for indoor marine
              shrimp production.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Is Biofloc fish farming successful ?</h3>
            <p>
              Biofloc is a Profitable Method of Fish Farming. ... Biofloc helps in cleaning the
              culture water of the fish while giving an additional source of feed. It is a
              sustainable and eco-friendly process. Rearing of fish at high-density requires some
              waste management system.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">How profitable is Biofloc fish farming ?</h3>
            <p>
              It was found that the production cost using biofloc technology was 20-30% higher than
              that of traditional fresh water method. But the total profit generated using biofloc
              technology was 23% higher than the profit generated using fresh water method.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">WHAT IS THE BIOFLOC TECHONOLOGY ?</h3>
            <p>
              The Biofloc technology is an intensive aquaculture system, in which Biofloc or
              bacterial floc is introduced into reinforced Geomembrane lined aquaculture ponds,
              which convert the waste eliminated by aquatic creatures into edible mass. This edible
              mass is rich in protein (50 to 65 % on dry matter basis), vitamins, and micronutrients
              and also has probiotic effect. It improves the immune system of the aquatic animal.
              Usually in the traditional system, feed requirement is approx. 1.5 Kg per Kg of
              biomass. In Biofloc system due to recycling process of metabolic waste, there is 30 %
              saving of feed. In traditional aquaculture systems, water exchange is required
              frequently, resulting in wastage of water and larger expenses. Biofloc significantly
              reduces the need to exchange water. Probiotic organisms like Bacillus, yeast etc. can
              be added to the pond water and feed to improve the immune system of the cultured
              animal. Bacillus licheniformis is able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic Vibrio
              species.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">ADVANTAGES OF BIOFLOC</h3>
            <p>
              • Improved Bio security <br />• Improved feed conversion <br />• Improved water use
              efficiency <br />• Increased land use efficiency <br />• Improved water quality
              control <br />• Reduced sensitivity to weather changes
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">DOES NFDB FINACIALLY ASSIST THE BIOFLOC TECHONOLOGY ?</h3>
            <p>
              National Fisheries Development Board has many Schemes assisting Various Farming
              Technologies under Innovative Farming. Bio Floc may be considered under Innovative
